# The 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force

The 2001 AUMF is central to understanding America's War on Terror, but does it count as a declaration of war?

## Abstract

How did a law passed in the wake of 9/11 lead to military actions in 14 countries, and on the high seas?
In speeches immediately after the 9/11 attacks, then President George W. Bush verbally and rhetorically declared war upon the organisations or states responsible for the attacks, but the 2001 AUMF provided the legal authorisation for the President to use force subsequent to the attacks.
The legal authorisation is important, as the President - and by extension the armed forces - is constrained in acting overseas without Congressional authorisation.
However, there are important caveats - the covert action authority under the 1947 National Security Act permits the President to authorise covert action by the CIA, and after 9/11 the CIA developed significant capabilities to conduct lethal action abroad.
Three successive Presidents of the United States have now relied upon the authority of the 2001 AUMF to conduct military operations, but this authority does not fit with idealised models of war and peace in international relations.
The 2001 AUMF is therefore a good case study for the contemporary role of law in the resort to force.
